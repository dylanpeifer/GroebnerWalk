                          The GroebnerWalk Package

The Groebner walk is a Groebner basis conversion algorithm. This means it takes
a Groebner basis of an ideal with respect to one monomial order and changes it
into a Groebner basis of the same ideal over a different monomial order.
Conversion algorithms can be useful since sometimes when a Groebner basis over
a difficult monomial order (such as lexicographic or an elimination order) is
desired, it can be faster to compute a Groebner basis directly over an easier
order (such as graded reverse lexicographic) and then convert rather than
computing directly in the original order.


                                Requirements

The package requires at least version 1.10 of Macaulay2.


                                Installation

The GroebnerWalk package is included in version 1.11 of Macaulay2. To load it,
type

    i1 : needsPackage "GroebnerWalk"

at the Macaulay2 prompt. If you are using an older version of Macaulay2 or wish
to reinstall or update the GroebnerWalk package, first download the package at 

    https://github.com/dylanpeifer/GroebnerWalk/archive/v1.0.0.tar.gz

and unpack the archive. Then place the file "GroebnerWalk.m2" in the "packages"
directory of your Macaulay2 install. Finally, type

    i1 : installPackage "GroebnerWalk"

at the Macaulay2 prompt to finish installation. This command may need to be
repeated if you previously had a version of GroebnerWalk installed.


                                Documentation

After the package has been loaded, package documentation can be accessed by
typing

    i2 : viewHelp GroebnerWalk

at the Macaulay2 prompt. Documentation for all top-level functions can also be
accessed through the standard Macaulay2 help system.
